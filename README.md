# Python List Operations Example

## Description

This Python script demonstrates common list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, popping, sorting, and indexing. It provides a straightforward example of manipulating a list step-by-step to help you understand basic list methods.

## Features

- Create an empty list.
- Append individual elements to the list.
- Insert an element at a specific position.
- Extend the list by adding multiple elements at once.
- Remove the last element from the list.
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Find the index of a specific element.
- Print the result of the index lookup and the final list.

## How the Script Works

1. Starts with an empty list named `my_list`.
2. Adds elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 using the `append()` method.
3. Inserts the value `15` at index 1 (second position) using `insert()`.
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60,the `extend()` method.
5. Removes the last element (`70`) using the `pop()` method.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order with the `sort()` method.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30` using the `index()` method.
8. Prints the final sorted list.

## Example Output

```
The index of 30 in my_list: 3
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```

## Usage

To run this script:

1. Copy the code into a Python file, for example, `list_operations.py`.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

```bash
python list_operations.py
```

3. Observe the printed output showing the index of `30` and the final state of the list.
